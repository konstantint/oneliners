One-liners collection
=====================

A collection of one-liner jokes (in English) scraped from various places in the Internet.

Usage
------
.. code-block::

     from oneliners import get_random

where ``category`` is one of ``'chuck'``, ``'pyjokes_en'``, ``'unsorted'`` or ``None`` (which means the union of all).


License
-------

 * The code is licensed as MIT. 
 * The jokes in the data files were scraped from various random places in the Internet. Some of them may be subject to copyright (which ones in particular, is, however, nearly impossible to determine, and most may probably be considered "folklore"). In any case, beware if you plan to display them publicly. Also beware that the "unsorted" collection is, indeed, completely unedited, and may contain adult, offensive or simply bad jokes.
